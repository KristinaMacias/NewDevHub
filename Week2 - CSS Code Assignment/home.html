        The thought of becoming a Software Engineer began during the start of
        the 2019 Global Pandemic. As the world was forced to socially distance
        and everyone was encouraged to limit interaction to the people that they
        lived with, I found myself having a lot of extra free time. Some of this
        free time was spent playing video games and some of it was spent
        engrossed in my new board game hobby. I spent most of my weekends
        learning how to play new board games - I should note that I wasn't
        learning a simple games like Monopoly. I was learning games with
        deep-rooted strategy, most of which had 30 to 100 page rule books. With
        this hobby, I had discovered that I gueninely loved and craved learning.
        I then did what any new hobbyist does - I created an entire Instagram
        account dedicated to it. I found an entire community people that, like
        me, loved to learn. As my Instagram following grew, a spark iginited in
        me and I decided that I needed a website.

        I spent a long time hovering over that idea and purchase the website
        domain. I thought about finding a trendy theme and deploying my website
        using Wordpress, but I knew deep down that I wanted to build my website
        from scratch. I purchased a Udemy course teaching Front End Web
        Development and I fell in love. I started to explore different career
        paths in Front End Web Development. I'll be honest, I was completely
        overwhelmed. It seemed like there was too much to learn - languages,
        frameworks, libraries, etc. I felt what some people describe as
        selection overload. I tried to create a curriculum for myself, but I
        found myself getting bogged down by the sheer amount of learning
        resources on the web. I could not differentiate what was critical for me
        to learn and when I needed to know it. I was worried that I was too old
        to start over and learn something new. After wasting a few more months
        contemplating and procrastinating, I had realized that time had passed
        without me stepping into this new idea. It no longer mattered to me how
        long it would take me to learn and that's when my journey in web
        development began.
